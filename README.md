# Message Encoding/Decoding System :closed_lock_with_key:

This project aims to implement a multi-processing approach for sending encoded messages that can only be decoded by the intended receiver. The system involves the use of several processes, including a sender process, receiver process, master spy process, helper processes, and spy processes. The system operates under the assumption that a successful operation occurs when the receiver can decode the messages before the master spy, while a failed operation occurs if the master spy decodes the messages first.

## üöÄ Application Scenario :clipboard:

The system follows the following scenario:

1. A parent process creates the necessary child processes: a single sender process, a single receiver process, a single master spy process, a user-defined number of helper processes, and a user-defined number of spy processes.
2. The sender process retrieves the message from an input file (e.g., `sender.txt`). The message may contain multiple lines and paragraphs.
3. The sender process splits the input file into columns based on the blank character between words.
4. Each child process is responsible for encoding a specific column message received from the sender process. The encoding process is as follows:
   - For the first column, each word is modified by adding 1 to the first character modulo 26, 2 to the second character modulo 26, and so on. The encoded message is then placed in the first location of the shared memory.
   - For the second column, each word is modified by adding 2 to the first character modulo 26, 4 to the second character modulo 26, and so on. The encoded message is then placed in the second location of the shared memory.
   - The same logic applies to subsequent columns and words in each column.
   - Special characters and numbers are encoded based on specific rules mentioned in the project requirements.
   - Each encoded column in the shared memory is identified by a unique prefix or suffix.
5. Helper processes continuously swap the messages present in the shared memory to hinder spy processes from obtaining all the columns of the file.
6. Spy processes randomly access shared memory locations to retrieve encoded messages and send them to the master spy process.
7. The master spy process attempts to order the columns in the correct order after receiving them from the spy processes. It drops any columns it has already received. Once confident it has received all the columns, it tries to decode the messages present in the `spy.txt` file.
8. The receiver process also randomly accesses shared memory locations to retrieve encoded messages. Similar to the master spy process, it orders the received columns correctly and discards any duplicates. Once confident it has received all the columns, it attempts to decode the messages present in the `receiver.txt` file.
9. The parent process determines whether the receiver process was able to obtain the correct file from the sender before the master spy process. If the receiver succeeds, the operation is considered successful; otherwise, it is labeled as a failed operation.
10. The simulation ends if any of the following conditions are met:
    - The number of failed decoding operations by the receiver exceeds a user-defined threshold.
    - The number of successful decoding operations by the receiver exceeds a user-defined threshold.
